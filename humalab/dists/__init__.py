"""Probability distributions for scenario randomization.

This module provides various probability distribution classes used in scenario generation,
including uniform, gaussian, bernoulli, categorical, discrete, log-uniform, and truncated
gaussian distributions. Each supports 0D (scalar) and multi-dimensional (1D-3D) variants.
